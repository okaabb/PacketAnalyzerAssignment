Make sure to include in the “cmake-build-debug” directory the input file named “input_packets.txt”. 
Make sure the input file is in “.txt” format.

Open the Project in any IDE and press Run. 

The expected output should be presented in an “output_packets.txt” file in the same directory as the input.

Comment the 12th line in the main.cpp file to present the output in the console, if preferred.
